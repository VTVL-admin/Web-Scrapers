# Web-Scrapers
Web scrapers were used to get investor data from a variety of websites, I primarily used Python to scrape the data. The packages I used were BeautifulSoup, Pyautogui, Selenium and Xlwings. BeautifulSoup was used to extract data from the html code, Pyautogui was used to control the graphical user interface, Selenium was used to handle the JavaScript for certain sites and Xlwings was used to parse the data to MS Excel. A data.txt file is used to hold data temporarily from the Sifted Women Investors Airtable, the text file must be cleared when running the code.
